I've been a professional software developer for 20 years. I've written a lot of
website applications and I absolutely love what I do. However, it's time to do
something for myself.

## Who is Electric Visions?

Originally founded in Bournemouth, Dorset, United Kingdom in 1998 it eventually
became a consultancy firm specializing in Agile software development and Web
technologies. It's now evolving to become a games developer house.

Electric Visions is run by one person (so far), me.

## A bit more about me

![ZorlandC][]

I was 7 years old when I got my first computer, a Commodore 64. It didn't take
me long to go from playing games to keying in the programs from the manual and
magazines.

When I was at school, Graham, a friend of mine, gave me a book on C programming
and I was hooked. Later, I programmed graphics, 3D, effects and made a few small
demos with Sean, another friend of mine and some games such as a tron light
cycle clone and 2 player Asteroids style shoot 'em up.

I also got into electronic music and music programs called trackers that allowed
you to trigger samples at certain times to create music. It was magical!

I played around with graphics software, 3D modelling software, even CAD
programs. Lego, Meccano and Scalextric also featured heavily. I loved creating
things with any medium I could get my hands on. One time I built a scale model
Spitfire out of balsa wood. It glided incredibly well. So well, in fact, it flew
straight into a tree! I enjoyed technical drawing at school and even toyed with
the idea of going to art college. However, programming was my true passion.

I've built PCs out of various materials, a tiny PC using a coffee tin and PCs
built into cars. My current setup is a custom built gaming chair and standing
desk with the PC built into the legs!

My name is Phil A Thompson. I live in the South of England with my wife, Claudi
and our dog,  Colin.

## My vision

Although I love what I do, I've had an idea for a game for 20 years. It's
changed a lot over the years, had plenty of false starts but it's always been
at the back of my mind.

So, I'm telling myself "I am a game designer". One day it will be true.
