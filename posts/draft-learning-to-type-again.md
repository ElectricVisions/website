# Learning To Type Again

So, a while ago I woke up one morning and could barely move my neck. I
still managed a 20km hike with the boys so it can't have been too bad. Except
that several months later it was still stiff and painful. I saw a physio and,
guess what? I spend too much time on my computer!

I did some research and decided I 'needed' a split keyboard. Prices range from
about £80 - £300 and beyond! I initially purchased the Epomaker Split 65. My
current keyboard being the Glorious GMMK 2, I knew I wanted a mechanical
keyboard. This pushes up the price and reduces the choice although this is
improving. However, the Epomaker proved to be the wrong choice for me. I
initially had some issues with missed keys which seemed to resolve later. The
main issue though, was the limited and frustrating Via software. Advanced
features like home row mods and other custom configuration weren't properly
implemented or relied on software that just didn't quite create a smooth
experience. I like the split form factor, I just needed a better implementation.
